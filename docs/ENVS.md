# Run-time environment variables

The app instance can be customized by passing the following variables to the Node.js environment at runtime. Some of these variables have been deprecated, and their full list can be found in the [file](./DEPRECATED_ENVS.md).

**IMPORTANT NOTE!** For _production_ build purposes all json-like values should be single-quoted. If it contains a hash (`#`) or a dollar-sign (`$`) the whole value should be wrapped in single quotes as well (see `dotenv` [readme](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv#variable-substitution) for the reference)

## Disclaimer about using variables

Please be aware that all environment variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` will be exposed to the browser. So any user can obtain its values. Make sure that for all 3rd-party services keys (e.g., Sentri, Auth0, WalletConnect, etc.) in the services administration panel you have created a whitelist of allowed origins and have added your app domain into it. That will help you prevent using your key by unauthorized app, if someone gets its value.
